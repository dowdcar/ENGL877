About the author


Carissa Dowden is a second year MA student studying cultural and historical geography under the direction of Dr. Rebecca Buller.
She received her BA in Public History and Geography from the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire and graduated as part of the Ronald E. McNair Scholar class of 2019. At Eau Claire, she studied the semiotic landscapes of welcomingness, Wisconsin dairy history and geography, and Chippewa Valley folk music heritage. Her history capstone paper, “Queen Cow and the Eau Claire Rule” won the Miller Prize for Outstanding History Papers. For her public history capstone, her interview with Nate Sorenson about his DIY Punk venue, which aired on WDRK Converge Radio, won the second-place award for News Series/Documentary (Radio) from the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association. Her master’s research is currently titled, “Cultural landscapes of commemoration and memorialization of Nebraska’s mythic rural west.” She draws her enthusiasm for learning about history and geography from reading both the Little House on the Prairie and Magic Treehouse series as a child, and her professors at UWEC who supported her curiosity about the world. She is currently the Geography Student Organization vice president and treasurer, as well as a graduate student representative for the Rural Geography Specialty Group of the American Association of Geographers. In her free time, she likes to sew her own clothing, play video games, and hang out with her cat Tiger.
