DH Publication #2.2, enhancing Dev. Report #6


For DH Publication #2, I chose to use StoryMap and a hand-drawn image to critically enhance Dev. Report #6’s images and metadata. I was most comfortable with the process of StoryMap, but ultimately, I thought it best showed the path and message I was trying to communicate through my original imagery.
I explored two blocks in Lincoln because I was curious about the different signs and imagery used to express mask mandating or pandemic platitudes within a confined area.Using StoryMaps, I was able to represent how small of an area I explored and the diverging practices of masking and social distancing. Many of the bars on O St. just use the county/city mandate flyer, presumably the first one they printed, given how torn and creased they’ve gotten. My favorite sign was in A Novel Idea’s window; an image of Rosie the Riveter wearing a mask calling people to vote. The image itself was simple, yet effective so I wanted to represent that in a larger colored image (I broke out my watercolors and everything!). So much of this pandemic has been politicized, so I thought it was appropriate to utilize a political image in response.
