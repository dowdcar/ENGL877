Process Narrative
The goal of this semester’s class was to contextualize the Coronavirus pandemic within the creation of DH materials, and better understand our own experiences within the pandemic and the US as a whole. Our project went from analyzing the local campus, to the external city, and eventually the larger region, it’s underlying histories and structures. In answering the prompts created by Dr. Wisnicki, I allowed myself to do field studies and research based on my interests and passions. I miss going to the library terribly, so for my first field study, I ventured to Love South to take pictures, and found interesting images of caution-taped areas, and confusing instructions to check out books. This created a story for me, not just of wearing a mask, but of changed time-space routines and dimensions of interactive landscapes, as well as a feasible way to make sense of the many “happenings” of this year.


Throughout all this contextualization, students were given access and tutorials on DH tools to express our research products, all of which can be seen throughout the site’s process. I structured my arguments from a humanistic geographer, a public historian, and an angry young woman’s point of view. At the end of this project, students considered the “vertical” parts of the pandemic, rather than just the “horizontal.” By focusing on the vertical, one can tell the basic history leading us to today, but then also explain the underlying societal structures, and better understand the viewpoints of those protesting and enacting change in response to everything which has happened. We all have different experiences which have lead us to this point in our lives. I come from a working class family, and am of Armenian descent, so while I understand generational and collective trauma, as a white woman, I recognize and accept that I have many inherent privileges that keep life relatively “easy” for me. By accepting these facts of life, we are better able to enact change alongside those who are fighting with their lives for it, and even use our bodies to defend theirs in battle. This introspection has been the ultimate product of this project, as racial injustice, colonial paradigms, and public health inequalities cannot be solved without the active participation and cooperation of those who hold positions of power.
